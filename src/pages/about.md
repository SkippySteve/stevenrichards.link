My name is Steve and I'm a senior year Computer Science major just looking to create some documentation of my journey through IT and programming.

## Professional Info
Currently in IT for about 3 years now, been with a couple different companies in that time. Started out in help desk and software support, have since moved onto a desktop/field support role.

Earned an Associates in Cybersecurity in 2023, currently working on finishing my Bachelors in Computer Science. I still love Cybersecurity but I wanted to go deeper into how computers work, and how I can make them do what I want, without relying on someone giving me permission through an app they built.

## Hobbies
I honestly don't enjoy much outside the world of computers. Perhaps I'm too obsessed, but it is what it is.

I enjoy Capture The Flag (CTF) competetions. I've participated in about 5 now. The last one I competed in spanned 3 days and I placed in the top 10%, and might land me an amazing scholorship.

I'm still learning DSA type materials even after two DSA courses in my Bachelors, and enjoy the challenges on [leetcode.com](https://www.leetcode.com) even though I'm not very good (yet). 

## Family
I have an amazing supportive family, including two children, that make everything I do professionally possible. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have the drive to keep going.

## Political and Religious Beliefs
Just kidding... probably wont share those here.
