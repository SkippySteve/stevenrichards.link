  What I'm currently up to.
---

Currently working on my last three courses in my Bachelors. 

Studying for CCNA, have an exam scheduled early November. 

Might get totally sidetracked in a week if I'm accepted to move onto stage two of a Cybersecurity scholorship where I can earn 4 SANS certifications.
